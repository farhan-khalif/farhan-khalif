# Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Profile

I'm **Farhan Khalif**, a beginner developer with a strong interest in learning and growing. 🚀 I'm on an exciting journey to build my skills and creating meaningful projects.

## 💻 What I'm Currently Learning
- **Full-Stack Web Development**: Mastery in both frontend (user interface) and backend (server, database, and application logic) development.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration and project management

## 📖 Projects
Here are some of my projects:
- **[shine Clean Project](https://farhan-khalif.github.io/clean_co/)**: A modern and fully responsive website.
- **[CSS Project](https://farhan-khalif.github.io/css-proj./)**: This project has a modern look but lacks responsiveness, I'm proud of this project as it marks a strong start..
- **[Grid project](https://farhan-khalif.github.io/grid_project/)**:This project is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen resolutions.
*(More projects coming soon as I continue to learn and grow!)*

## 📈 My Goals
1. Build and maintain Beautiful Website.
2. Collaborate with like-minded developers to create impactful solutions.
